    reason: "# Memory Loop — Project Status (2026-02-22)\n\n## What It Is\nMemory Loop is a mobile-friendly web interface for interacting with Obsidian vaults via Claude AI. It runs as a local server (Next.js 15 + Claude Agent SDK) organized around the GCTR framework: **Ground**, **Capture**, **Think**, **Recall**.\n\n## Architecture\n- **Monorepo**: `nextjs/` (App Router UI + API routes + SSE), `backend/` (library: Agent SDK, vault ops), `shared/` (Zod schemas, types)\n- **Communication**: REST for stateless ops, SSE for AI chat streaming\n- **Data**: Vault-as-source-of-truth (all user data is markdown files in Obsidian vaults)\n\n---\n\n## Completed Work (16 retros logged)\nThe project has been through significant evolution:\n- **Next.js migration** from Hono + WebSocket → Next.js + REST + SSE\n- **Workspace consolidation** — backend/shared collapsed into Next.js\n- **Single WebSocket → SSE consolidation**\n- **Vi Mode for Pair Writing** — full implementation with word motions\n- **Daily Prep System** — bookend planning feature\n- **Card Deduplication** — spaced repetition improvement\n- **Test coverage baseline** — discovered half of backend tests weren't running, fixed\n- **GitHub OAuth auth** implementation\n- **systemd service** post-migration fixes\n- **Content root + instrumentation** fixes\n\n## Implemented Specs\n| Spec | Status |\n|------|--------|\n| Card Deduplication | ✅ Implemented |\n| Daily Prep System | ✅ Implemented |\n| Vi Mode for Pair Writing | ✅ Implemented |\n\n## Executed Plans (7)\nCollapse workspaces, content root fix, daily prep, Next.js consolidation, test coverage to 80%+, pairwriting discussion fix, vi mode (base + word motions)\n\n---\n\n## Active / In-Progress Work\n\n### 🔴 Server-Driven Chat (spec: approved)\n**Priority: High.** Decouples chat processing from client connectivity. Server processes each message to completion regardless of SSE connection state. Clients become \\\"viewports\\\" that can disconnect/reconnect freely. Triggered by a production bug: race condition in `runStreaming`'s finally block clobbers new session state over cellular/VPN.\n\nKey requirements defined: state snapshots for reconnecting clients, no event replay (snapshot-based), pending prompts survive disconnects, generation guard for concurrent cleanup.\n\n### 🟡 Image WebP Conversion (spec: draft)\nServer-side conversion of uploaded images to WebP via `cwebp` binary. All raster uploads (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, AVIF, ICO) converted before storage. Animated image support. Graceful fallback if `cwebp` unavailable. Spec is complete and detailed but still in draft.\n\n---\n\n## Open Items\n\n### 🐛 Bugs\n- **Agent SDK .mjs type declarations** (upstream) — typescript-eslint can't resolve `.mjs` imports in SDK's `.d.ts` files, causing 21 false-positive lint errors across `session-streamer.ts`, `session-manager.ts`, `fact-extractor.ts`. Workaround: eslint overrides. Awaiting upstream fix.\n- **13 silent failure findings** from SDC review — conversations hanging forever on failed permission resolution, SSE serialization errors swallowed, partial result persistence failures hidden, streaming state set before fetch succeeds, abort errors ignored. All documented with proposed fixes.\n\n### 💡 Open Brainstorms\n- **CSS Modules migration** — Convert 46 plain CSS files to CSS Modules for dead CSS detection. Design tokens and theming survive unchanged. Clear trade-off defined. Previous attempt failed (retro logged); incremental approach recommended.\n- **Agentic data source pattern** — Architecture for integrating external services (e.g., email) via MCP servers, notification channels, and frontend routes. Pattern defined but no implementation started.\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks & Observations\n1. **SDC is the critical path** — The server-driven chat spec addresses a production bug affecting mobile/VPN users. It's approved and ready for implementation.\n2. **Silent failures are documented but unfixed** — 13 findings from the SDC review represent real user-facing issues (hung conversations, lost data, wrong UI state).\n3. **SDK upstream bug** is manageable with eslint overrides but adds friction on every SDK upgrade.\n4. **Strong documentation culture** — 16 retros, detailed specs with success criteria and AI validation plans, reference docs for all features. The project learns from its mistakes systematically."
