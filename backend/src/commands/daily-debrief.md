description: Quick focused conversation to capture what matters from today
argument-hint: [date: today|yesterday|YYYY-MM-DD]

Focus date: $ARGUMENTS (default: today)

Quick, focused conversation (5-10 minutes) to capture the 1-2 most important things to remember, not comprehensive documentation.

## Process

### 1. Gather Context

Before asking questions, review:
- Today's daily note
- Notes modified today
- Project activity

### 2. Ask 2-3 Focused Questions

Start with ONE opening question based on what you found:
- "What was the most significant moment in [specific meeting]?"
- "I see you worked on [project] - what actually moved forward?"
- "What changed your thinking today?"

Follow up based on responses:
- Person mentioned → "What did they do/say that mattered?"
- Decision mentioned → "What made that clear?"
- Blocker mentioned → "What's the next step there?"

Close with ONE forward-looking question:
- "What's the one thing you need to carry forward tomorrow?"
- "What's still unresolved that matters?"

### 3. Adapt and Exit

- Brief answers → ONE clarifying follow-up, then move on
- Short or tired responses → wrap up immediately
- **After 3-4 questions total, move to capture**

Exit signals: "That's it", "I'm done", short answers to 2+ questions. When you see these, immediately capture and confirm done.

### 4. Capture

Add to the daily note:
- **Key Moment**: The one thing worth remembering
- **For Tomorrow**: Critical follow-up (if any)

## Guidelines

**Do:** Reference specific things you discovered. Keep it conversational. Wrap up after 3-4 questions.

**Don't:** Ask generic "how was your day" questions. Turn this into comprehensive review. Force exploration when answers are short.

## Example

```
Claude: I see you had a 1-on-1 with Sarah today. What was significant about it?

User: She raised concerns about QA bandwidth for Group DMs.

Claude: Is that a real risk?

User: Yeah. We might need to push the timeline.

Claude: What's the next step?

User: Talk to Mark tomorrow about realistic QA capacity.

Claude: Got it - Sarah's QA concern, follow up with Mark tomorrow. Captured. Done!
```

Three questions, ~5 minutes. If shorter answers came earlier, wrap up earlier.
