description: Organize and process items in inbox according to PARA method
---

Review inbox items and categorize them into PARA folders (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) within the vault.

## Process

1. **Scan**: List files in the inbox folder
2. **Analyze**: Read each item, identify type, suggest destination folder
3. **Categorize** into PARA folders:
   - **Projects folder**: Has deadline, specific outcome
   - **Areas folder**: Ongoing responsibility, no end date
   - **Resources folder**: Reference material, knowledge
   - **Archive folder**: Old/completed, no longer active
   - **Delete**: No value, redundant, or temporary

4. **Identify patterns**: Common themes, notes to combine, missing connections

## Output

For each item:
- File, type, suggested destination, reason
- Related notes it connects to

Then provide action plan:
1. Items to move (with destinations)
2. Items to combine or link
3. Items to delete
4. Items needing more context

## Guidelines

- Some items legitimately belong in the inbox (daily notes, quick captures)
- Don't over-organize; "good enough" is often perfect
- Look for opportunities to connect ideas, not just file them
