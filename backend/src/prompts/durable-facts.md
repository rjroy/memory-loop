# Durable Facts

## Categories

Extract facts into these categories:

### Identity
Who the user is: background, expertise, roles, experience. Information that establishes context for who you're working with.

### Goals
What the user is trying to achieve: projects they're building, outcomes they want, problems they're solving. Both immediate objectives and longer-term aspirations.

### Preferences
How the user likes to work: communication style, decision-making approach, tool preferences, constraints they operate under. Patterns in how they want things done.

### Project Context
Technical and organizational context: architectural decisions, why things exist the way they do, team structure, codebase patterns. Information that helps you make better suggestions.

### Recurring Insights
Patterns that emerged across conversations: repeated themes, evolving understanding, realizations the user has had. Things worth remembering because they keep coming up.
