  **Meeting Notes — Audience with Assistant**
  Meeting ID: audience-Assistant-20260222-184838-2
  Date: 2026-02-22 (started 2026-02-23T02:48:38Z)
  Project: memory-loop
  Worker: Assistant
  
  **Summary**
  
  This was a brief connectivity and functionality test for the communication system between the user and the Assistant worker. The user confirmed that this was the second session, referencing a prior exchange where the Assistant had greeted with "Hello!" The session consisted of four short exchanges verifying that messages were being sent and received correctly.
  
  A minor typo ("Hell!" instead of "Hello!") was introduced by the user when recounting the first session and was quickly corrected. The user also tested whether the Assistant retained context across messages within the same session by asking it to recall the conversation so far, which it did accurately.
  
  No substantive project work was performed. The session served purely as a system validation exercise to confirm that the audience-based communication channel is operational.
  
  **Key Decisions**
  
  None. No decisions were made during this session.
  
  **Artifacts Produced or Referenced**
  
  None.
  
  **Open Items / Follow-ups**
  
  - Communication system confirmed functional; ready for use in real working sessions.
  - No technical issues identified during testing.
