Focus week: $ARGUMENTS (default: this week)

Guided conversation (10-15 minutes) to process what mattered this week and prepare for next week.

## Process

### 1. Gather Context

Before asking questions, review:
- This week's daily notes
- Notes modified this week
- Project activity and progress

### 2. Ask Adaptive Questions

Start with the week's theme, then dig into what matters:

**Theme and through-line:**
- "What was the week really about, underneath the task list?"
- "What single thing had the most impact on how the week went?"

**Key moments and learning:**
- "What conversation changed your thinking?"
- "What do you understand now that you didn't on Monday?"
- "Who unblocked significant work?"

**Momentum and next week:**
- "What has real forward movement? What's stuck?"
- "What's the most important thing to accomplish next week?"
- "What needs to shift to make next week better?"

### 3. Adapt Based on Responses

- Brief answers → dig deeper with follow-ups
- Something significant → help expand on why it matters
- Stuck → offer prompts based on what you saw in notes
- Overwhelmed → focus on 2-3 critical themes
- Connect threads across days to surface patterns

### 4. Capture

Update the weekly summary note with:
- **Week in Review**: 2-3 sentence summary
- **Key Moments**: Conversations, decisions, breakthroughs
- **Progress**: What moved forward
- **Learnings**: Insights and realizations
- **For Next Week**: Priorities and follow-ups

## Guidelines

**Do:** Start broad, then follow threads. Reference specific things you discovered. Help connect dots across days. Draw out insights through questions.

**Don't:** Ask generic "how was your week" questions. List all questions at once. Force through every day in detail. Generate summaries without conversation.

## Example

```
Claude: Looking at your week, I see project standups plus deep technical work
mid-week. What was this week really about for you?

User: [responds]

Claude: Which of those actually needs your focus next week?

User: [responds]

Claude: You mentioned feeling scattered. What's one thing you could do
differently next week to feel more focused?

User: [responds]

Claude: Got it. Let me capture: [summarizes themes, priorities, follow-ups]
```
