# File Browser View Specification

**Reverse-Engineered**: true
**Source Module**: frontend/src/components/BrowseMode.tsx, frontend/src/components/FileTree.tsx, frontend/src/components/MarkdownViewer.tsx, backend/src/file-browser.ts

## Executive Summary

The File Browser View (also called "Browse Mode" or "Recall") provides a split-pane interface for exploring, viewing, and making quick adjustments to markdown files within an Obsidian vault through a web browser. Users can navigate a hierarchical file tree on the left to select files, which are then rendered with full markdown formatting on the right. An "Adjust" mode allows direct editing of file content for quick tweaks without leaving the app. The system supports responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile devices, with the tree panel collapsing into a slide-out overlay on smaller screens. All file access is secured within the vault boundary using path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

The feature enables users to browse their vault's structure, read notes, and make small corrections without switching to the Obsidian desktop application, making it ideal for quick reference and minor edits on mobile devices or web-based workflows. Wiki-links within rendered markdown are clickable and navigate to related notes, preserving the interconnected nature of Obsidian vaults.

## User Stories

As a vault owner accessing Memory Loop from a mobile device or web browser, I want to browse and read my Obsidian notes in a file tree interface, so that I can quickly reference existing knowledge without opening the desktop application.

As a Memory Loop user viewing a recalled note, I want to make small adjustments directly in the app, so that I don't have to switch to another tool for minor edits like marking tasks done, fixing typos, or promoting bullets to tasks.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary**: Vault owners using Memory Loop's web interface on mobile or desktop browsers
- **Secondary**:
  - Backend developers maintaining file access security
  - Frontend developers managing responsive layouts
  - UX designers ensuring mobile-friendly navigation patterns

## Success Criteria

1. Users can navigate the entire vault directory structure through an expandable/collapsible tree interface
2. Markdown files render with proper formatting, including headings, lists, code blocks, and wiki-links
3. Path traversal attempts (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`) are blocked at the backend with appropriate error messages
4. Mobile users can access the file tree via an overlay that doesn't obscure content when dismissed
5. File tree maintains expansion state during navigation (expanded folders remain open)
6. Wiki-link navigation works correctly for both root and nested files with relative path resolution
7. Users can edit any displayed `.md` file and save changes back to the vault
8. Edits persist to the vault filesystem immediately on Save
9. No data loss - original content preserved if user cancels or encounters an error

- Do NOT allow reading or writing of non-markdown files (security risk, performance concern)
- Do NOT pre-load the entire vault directory tree on mount (lazy-load only)
- Do NOT follow symbolic links (security risk for path traversal)
- Do NOT expose absolute filesystem paths to the frontend (leak system structure)
- Do NOT render raw HTML in markdown without sanitization (XSS risk)
- Do NOT support file upload or deletion (only read and in-place edit of existing files)
- Do NOT cache file content across sessions (only cache directory listings)
- Do NOT allow directory listing of files starting with `.` (system files, .obsidian config)
- Do NOT implement syntax highlighting in the edit textarea
- Do NOT implement live markdown preview while editing
- Do NOT add undo/redo functionality beyond browser defaults
- Do NOT support creating new files from the Recall tab
- Do NOT add auto-save functionality
- Do NOT add a confirmation dialog before canceling (simple Cancel is sufficient)

## Technical Context

- **Existing Stack**:
  - Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Bun test
  - Backend: Bun, Hono, Node.js fs/promises
  - Protocol: WebSocket with Zod-validated discriminated unions
  - Markdown: react-markdown with remark-gfm plugin

- **Integration Points**:
  - SessionContext for vault selection, browser state, and edit mode state (`isAdjusting`, `adjustContent`)
  - useWebSocket hook for real-time communication with backend
  - VaultManager for vault path resolution
  - WebSocket handler for message routing
  - file-browser.ts backend module for read/write operations

- **Patterns to Respect**:
  - Components in `frontend/src/components/` with co-located `.css` files
  - Backend modules in `backend/src/` with co-located `__tests__/` directories
  - Zod schemas in `shared/src/protocol.ts` for all WebSocket messages
  - Custom error classes with `.code` property for type-safe error handling
  - Strict TypeScript with no implicit any
  - Unit tests with filesystem mocking using temp directories
  - CSS Grid for layout (not flexbox for main structure)
  - Mobile-first responsive design with CSS media queries

## Acceptance Tests

1. **File Tree Renders Vault Root**: Given vault with files [notes.md, docs/], when Browse Mode loads, then tree displays both entries sorted (docs/ first)

2. **Directory Expansion Loads Children**: Given directory with nested files, when user clicks directory chevron, then children appear indented beneath parent

3. **File Selection Displays Content**: Given file tree with notes.md, when user clicks notes.md, then markdown content renders in viewer pane

4. **Wiki-Link Navigation Works**: Given file with `[[other-note]]` link, when user clicks link, then other-note.md loads in viewer

5. **Path Traversal Blocked**: Given user requests `../../../etc/passwd.md`, then server returns error with code `PATH_TRAVERSAL`

6. **Non-Markdown Files Rejected**: Given user requests `image.png`, then server returns error with code `INVALID_FILE_TYPE`

7. **Large File Truncated**: Given file larger than 1MB, when user opens file, then first 1MB displays with truncation warning banner

8. **Mobile Tree Overlay Functions**: Given mobile viewport, when user taps hamburger menu, then tree appears as overlay with backdrop

9. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Given file at `docs/api/guide.md`, when breadcrumb displays "Root / docs / api / guide.md", then clicking "docs" navigates to docs directory

10. **Pinned Folders Persist**: Given user pins "Projects" folder, when user refreshes page, then "Projects" appears in Pinned section at top of tree

11. **Empty Directory Shows Placeholder**: Given directory with no visible files (all hidden), when user expands directory, then "(empty)" text displays

12. **Context Menu on Right-Click**: Given directory entry, when user right-clicks entry, then context menu appears with "Pin to top" option

13. **Long-Press for Mobile Context Menu**: Given directory entry on mobile, when user long-presses entry (500ms), then context menu appears

14. **Symlinks Excluded from Listings**: Given vault with symlink to external directory, when listing directory, then symlink does not appear in tree

15. **WebSocket Reconnection Recovers State**: Given user has expanded directories and selected file, when WebSocket reconnects, then expanded state preserved and file remains visible

16. **Auto-Load from External Navigation**: Given RecentActivity shows "View" button for note.md, when user clicks "View" and switches to Browse mode, then note.md automatically loads in viewer

17. **Keyboard Navigation in Tree**: Given focused directory entry, when user presses Enter key, then directory expands/collapses

18. **External Links Open in New Tab**: Given markdown with `[Example](https://example.com)`, when rendered, then link has `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

19. **Hidden Files Excluded**: Given vault with `.obsidian/` directory, when listing root, then `.obsidian/` does not appear

20. **Case-Insensitive Extension Check**: Given file named `note.MD` (uppercase), when user selects file, then content loads successfully

21. **Basic Edit Round-Trip**: Given a loaded file, when user clicks Adjust, modifies text, and clicks Save, then file on disk reflects changes and viewer shows updated content

22. **Cancel Discards Changes**: Given a file in adjust mode with modifications, when user clicks Cancel, then original content is restored in viewer and no changes written to disk

23. **Escape Key Cancels**: Given a file in adjust mode, when user presses Escape, then adjust mode exits without saving

24. **Navigation Clears Edit State**: Given a file in adjust mode, when user clicks a different file in the tree, then new file loads normally without stale edit state

25. **Edit Error Preserves Content**: Given adjust mode with modifications, when save fails (mock permission error), then error message displays and textarea content remains editable

26. **Write Path Traversal Blocked**: Given user attempts to write to path containing `../`, then server rejects with PATH_TRAVERSAL error

27. **Write File Type Validation**: Given user attempts to write to a `.txt` file, then server rejects with INVALID_FILE_TYPE error

28. **Mobile Edit Layout**: Given viewport under 600px, when user enters adjust mode, then Adjust button is accessible and textarea is usable

29. **Reload Button Clears Cache**: Given user has expanded directories and files are cached, when user clicks the Reload button (♻), then directory cache is cleared and file tree is re-fetched from server

30. **Frontmatter Renders as Table**: Given markdown file with YAML frontmatter, when file is displayed in viewer, then frontmatter renders as a formatted table rather than raw YAML text

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should the system support downloading markdown files as text for offline access?
- [ ] Should pinned items be stored server-side (in session metadata) or client-side (localStorage)?
- [ ] Should the file tree support drag-and-drop reordering of pinned items?
- [ ] Should the system support syntax highlighting for code blocks in markdown?
- [ ] Should breadcrumb segments show folder icons to distinguish from file names?

## Out of Scope

- File creation or deletion (only edit existing files in-place)
- Full-text search across vault files
- File preview for non-markdown files (images, PDFs, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks or edit textarea
- Multi-file selection or bulk operations
- File drag-and-drop reordering
- Customizable theme for markdown rendering
- Offline caching of file content (only directory structure cached)
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits from desktop app
- Version history or git integration
- Live markdown preview while editing
- Inline task checkbox toggling (handled by Task List feature)
- Collaborative editing
- Version history / undo beyond single session

**Related**: [Task List](2025-12-31-task-list.md) - shares the Recall tab with toggle between File Tree and Task List views

**Next Phase**: This specification was reverse-engineered from existing implementation. Use `/spiral-grove:plan-generation` if refactoring or extending this feature.
