# Using Memory Loop

Memory Loop is organized around four tabs, each designed for a specific mode of interaction with your Obsidian vault.

## The Four Tabs

| Tab | Icon | Purpose | Use when... |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| [Ground](./ground.md) | 🪨 | Home dashboard | Starting your session, checking goals, accessing recent activity |
| [Capture](./capture.md) | 🪶 | Quick note entry | Capturing a thought quickly without friction |
| [Think](./think.md) | ✨ | AI conversation | Exploring ideas, running commands, analyzing notes |
| [Recall](./recall.md) | 🪞 | File browsing | Reading notes, searching, editing, reviewing tasks |

## Quick Start

**New to Memory Loop?** Here's a suggested first session:

1. **Ground**: See your vault name and any goals you've set
2. **Capture**: Jot down a quick thought to test the capture flow
3. **Ground**: Notice your capture appears in Recent Activity
4. **Think**: Ask Claude something about your vault
5. **Recall**: Browse your files and find the daily note with your capture

## Navigation

The tab bar appears at the bottom of the screen (mobile) or top (desktop). Tap any tab to switch views.

Each tab maintains its state when you switch away. Your draft messages, scroll positions, and selected files persist as you move between tabs.

## Common Patterns

### Capture Then Reflect

1. Throughout the day, use **Capture** for quick thoughts
2. End the day on **Ground** and tap **Daily Debrief**
3. **Think** summarizes your captures and surfaces themes

### Read Then Discuss

1. Use **Recall** to find and read a note
2. Long-press and select "Think about"
3. **Think** opens with the file path ready for discussion

### Goal-Driven Session

1. Start on **Ground** to see your goals
2. Tap the goals card to discuss progress in **Think**
3. Update goals in **Recall** using adjust mode
