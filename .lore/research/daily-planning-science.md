# Research: Science of Daily Planning

## Summary

The research validates several intuitions from the brainstorm while adding important nuances. Key findings: implementation intentions (if-then planning) have robust effects on goal attainment; energy management outperforms pure time management; the bookend pattern (morning commitment + evening reflection) has strong empirical support; and decision fatigue argues for making task selection early and simple.

## Key Findings

### 1. Implementation Intentions Work

Peter Gollwitzer's research on "implementation intentions" shows that if-then planning significantly improves goal attainment.

**What they are**: Plans that specify when, where, and how to act. "If situation X, then I will do Y." This contrasts with goal intentions ("I want to lose 10 pounds") which lack specificity.

**The evidence**: A meta-analysis of 94 studies (8,000+ participants) found a medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.65). Difficult goals were completed ~3x more often when paired with implementation intentions.

**How they work**: Gollwitzer describes it as "passing control to the environment." By linking actions to situational cues, the behavior becomes automatic rather than requiring willpower.

**Limitation**: Works best when the opportunity for action is fleeting. Repeated behaviors (like daily exercise) may not produce the same urgency, leading to varied results.

**Implication for daily prep**: The commitment should be specific enough to trigger action. "Review Roman's PR" is better than "make progress on code review."

### 2. Energy Management > Time Management

Loehr and Schwartz's 2003 book "The Power of Full Engagement" established that managing energy produces better outcomes than managing time alone.

**Core insight**: Time management treats every hour as equal. Biology says otherwise. Your capacity for deep work, creativity, and decision-making fluctuates predictably throughout the day.

**Four energy sources**: Physical, emotional, spiritual, mental. Productivity requires balancing expenditure and restoration across all four.

**Chronotypes matter**: Individual differences in circadian rhythms (morning larks vs night owls) significantly impact when different types of work should happen. Aligning schedule with chronotype maximizes cognitive function.

**Peak times**: Most people reach peak energy a few hours after waking, followed by a decline hitting a low around 3pm. The trough is actually better for creative tasks because distractions help make unexpected connections.

**Implication for daily prep**: Energy check should be first input. "What kind of day is this?" gates what tasks make sense.

### 3. Morning Planning Has Measurable ROI

**Time recovery**: A 2024 study showed 10-12 minutes of morning planning can recover nearly 2 hours of lost time and boost productivity by 25%.

**Stress reduction**: Research from UC shows working from a clear plan reduces cortisol levels by up to 50%. Uncertainty activates the amygdala (threat detection); plans reduce perceived threat.

**Habit formation**: Habits form more effectively when tied to specific times and contexts. Morning planning as a ritual becomes self-reinforcing.

**Adoption gap**: Despite benefits, 82% of people work without a formal planning routine.

### 4. Commitment Devices Create Follow-Through

Behavioral economics research shows that precommitment increases goal attainment by raising the cost of deviation.

**Definition**: A commitment device locks you into a plan you might not want to follow in the moment, but know is good for you.

**How they work**: Daniel Goldstein describes establishing commitments in "cold states" to protect against impulsive decisions in "hot states."

**Evidence**: Commitment devices have increased gym-going, raised smoking quit rates by 40%, and boosted medical adherence.

**What makes them effective**: Greater cost of breaking = more effective (Dolan et al., 2010). Public commitments leverage social pressure and reputation.

**Implication for daily prep**: The commitment itself is a commitment device. Writing it down, even privately, increases follow-through. Showing it on the Ground tab creates visibility.

### 5. Evening Reflection Improves Performance

**Harvard study**: Call center trainees who spent 15 minutes reflecting on their day increased productivity by 22.8%. Another analysis showed 25% performance increase vs control group.

**Memory benefits**: Writing improves encoding, leading to 20-23% better recall of facts and ideas.

**Focus enhancement**: 88% of active journalers report enhanced focus as primary benefit.

**Goal achievement**: Writing down goals and reviewing them increases completion rate by 42%.

**Historical precedent**: Seneca practiced evening reflection: "I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself."

**Implication for daily prep**: The evening closure isn't optional. The bookend structure (morning + evening) is what creates the evaluable contract.

### 6. The Planning Fallacy (and How to Beat It)

Kahneman and Tversky's research shows we systematically underestimate time, costs, and risks while overestimating benefits.

**The "inside view"**: We focus on specifics of the current task, ignoring base rates from similar past tasks. Psychology students estimated 33.9 days for theses; actual average was 55.5 days.

**It's robust**: Affects small tasks (household chores) and large (infrastructure projects). Generalizes across personality, culture, individual and group projects.

**The fix - reference class forecasting**: Compare current task to similar past tasks. Plot how long each took. Use that distribution, not your optimistic estimate.

**Implication for daily prep**: Don't ask "what can I do today?" Ask "what have I actually done on similar days?" The surfacing categories (Pressure/Slipping/Quick Wins) should help calibrate against reality.

### 7. Open Loops Drain Cognitive Resources (Zeigarnik Effect)

**The phenomenon**: Unfinished tasks occupy working memory more than completed tasks. Bluma Zeigarnik noticed waiters recalled unpaid orders better than paid ones.

**Why it happens**: Incomplete tasks create "quasi-need" - psychological tension that keeps the work front-of-mind until resolved.

**The downside**: 4+ concurrent unfinished tasks significantly increase cognitive load, reduce willpower, increase stress.

**The fix**: Baumeister found that making concrete plans for incomplete goals reduces intrusive thoughts. You don't have to complete the task - you just have to plan it.

**Implication for daily prep**: The commitment isn't about completing everything today. It's about deciding what's "on" and what's "off" so open loops don't drain you.

### 8. Decision Fatigue and Task Selection

**The concept**: Quality of decisions deteriorates after a long session of decision-making. Derived from Baumeister's strength model of self-control.

**Impact on planning**: Decision-fatigued individuals are less willing to engage in planning and more avoidant. Planning requires executive functions that deplete under fatigue.

**Practical implication**: Make important decisions (including what to work on) early in the day. Simplify the decision process.

**Scientific caveat**: Replication studies have cast doubt on the strength of ego depletion effects. Carol Dweck found decision fatigue primarily affects those who *believe* willpower is limited. The effect may be partially about beliefs, not just biology.

**Implication for daily prep**: Keep task selection simple. The guided prompts (Pressure/Slipping/Quick Wins) reduce decision load by presenting curated options rather than a raw list of 100+ tasks.

| Commitment in your own words | Strong | Implementation intentions, commitment devices |
| Evening reflection | Strong | Journaling research, encoding effects |
| Surfacing "slipping" items | Moderate | Zeigarnik effect, open loop closure |
| Calendar shape input | Moderate | Energy sequencing, task-type matching |
| Pattern feedback over time | Theoretical | Reference class forecasting |

## What the Research Doesn't Cover

- **LLM-assisted planning**: No research yet on using AI as planning partner vs. purely human reflection
- **Multi-domain planning**: Research tends to focus on single-domain goals (exercise, work tasks), not balancing professional/personal/health
- **Vault-based context**: The idea of surfacing from your own notes is novel; research uses researcher-defined task lists

## Notes

The research strongly validates the bookend pattern. Morning commitment + evening reflection isn't just "nice to have" - it's foundational to multiple psychological mechanisms:

1. Implementation intentions make goals specific
2. Commitment devices increase follow-through
3. Evening reflection improves encoding and performance
4. Concrete plans close open loops (Zeigarnik relief)
5. Early task selection avoids decision fatigue

The one thing the research cautions against: over-planning. The commitment should be specific but not exhaustive. 1-3 items, not a detailed schedule. Leave room for the day to unfold.
