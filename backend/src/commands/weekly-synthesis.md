Create a written synthesis of the week's work, patterns, and insights.

## Process

1. **Gather**: All notes created and modified this week, projects that saw activity
2. **Identify patterns**: Recurring themes, challenges, breakthroughs
3. **Synthesize learning**: Key insights, how thinking evolved, connections discovered
4. **Assess progress**: What advanced, what's blocked, what emerged

## Output

Create a weekly synthesis note containing:

- **Week at a Glance**: Notes created, projects active, major accomplishments
- **Key Themes**: 2-3 recurring themes with context and significance
- **Major Insights**: Key realizations with context
- **Progress by Project**: What advanced, what's blocked, next focus
- **Questions Emerged**: New questions and why they matter
- **Connections Made**: Links between notes/concepts discovered
